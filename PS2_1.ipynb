        "For this assignment you will use PyTorch instead of EDF to implement and train neural networks. The experiments in this assignment will take a long time to run without a GPU, but you can run the notebook remotely on Google Colab and have access to GPUs for free -- in this case you don't have to worry about installing PyTorch as it is available by default in Google Colab's environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In case you will be running the experiments in your own machine, you should install PyTorch -- there are multiple tutorials online and it is especially easy if you're using Anaconda. Check https://pytorch.org/tutorials/ for some PyTorch tutorials -- this assignment assumes that you know the basics like defining models with multiple modules and coding up functions to train models with PyTorch optimizers. To \n",
        "\n",
        "To use Google Colab, you should access https://colab.research.google.com/ and upload this notebook to your workspace. To use a GPU, go to Edit -> Notebook settings and select GPU as the accelerator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike previous assignments, in this one you will have to do some writing instead of just coding. Try to keep your answers short and precise, and you are encouraged to write equations if needed (you can do that using markdown cells). You can also use code as part of your answers (like plotting and printing, etc). Blue text indicates questions or things that you should discuss/comment, and there will red \"ANSWER (BEGIN)\" and \"ANSWER (END)\" markdown cells to indicate that you should add cells with your writeup between these two. **Make sure not to redefine variables or functions in your writeup, which can change the behavior of the next cells.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you might have to do minor changes to the provided code due to differences in python/pytorch versions. You can post on piazza if there's a major, non-trivial change that you had to do (so other students can be aware of it and how to proceed), but for minor changes you should just apply them and keep working on the assignment."
